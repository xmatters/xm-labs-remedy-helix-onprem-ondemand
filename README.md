# BMC Remedy and Helix Incident Flow Designer Integration
Notify on-call response teams when critical incidents are reported in Remedy or Helix. With the xMatters and BMC Remedy/Helix (Cloud or On-premise) closed-loop integration, the on-call members of resolver teams are automatically notified via multiple communication channels. When the recipient responds, notes are added to the incident work log and specific incident actions may take place depending on the response.

# Pre-Requisites
* Version 19.08 or later of Remedy/Helix Cloud or On-premise (on-premise uses the xMatters Agent)
* Note, this integration version includes support for version 19.02, and earlier, which POSTs to xMatters using SOAP/XML 
* Account in Remedy/Helix
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!

# Files

# How it works
Remedy/Helix triggers one of the xMatters filters as part of the integration. The filter POSTs the Remedy/Helix Incident ID to xMatters, and in turn xMatters uses a Remedy/Helix REST API to get the incident properties and subsequently creates the xMatters Event targeted to the assigned resolver Group.

The notified resolver responds with Assign to me - to take ownership of the incident or Escalate - to escalate to the next resource in the on call schedule.

The closed loop integration annotates the incident work info with xMatters event status, notification delivery status, user responses and user comments. Additionally, an Assign to me response assigns the user to the incident and updates the incident status to In Progress.

## Remedy/Helix set up
Configuring BMC Remedy or Helix to integrate with xMatters requires the following steps:

* Import the workflow definition files
* Configure filters
* Configure the ITSM user
* Disable automatic assignments

### Importing workflow definition files
* Log in to the BMC Remedy Developer Studio, and then select **File** > **Import**
* Select **BMC Remedy Developer Studio** > **Object Definitions**, and then click **Next**
* Select the AR System server into which you want to upload the integration objects, and then click **Next**
* Do one of the following:  
      Type in the location of the `xm_foundation_REST.def` file  
      Click the Browse button to the right of the text field and navigate to the location of the `xm_foundation_REST.def` file. Select the file, and then click **Open**.  
* Click **Next**  
      If you have already imported a workflow definition file, ensure that you select the Replace Objects on the Destination Server check box (do not select the other check boxes), but note that any changes you have made to those objects will be lost. If you are sure the changes you made are necessary for your installation, you will be required to re-apply those changes to the new version of the files being imported unless you applied those changes to overlay objects.  
* Repeat the above steps to import the `xm_incident_REST.def` file.  
      Note this file must be imported after the foundation file.  
Click **Finish**

### Configuring filters
The integration includes a filter and an escalation that use the Set Fields action to consume a web service; these objects need their endpoints changed to the address of the appropriate (JSON or XML) *Step 01 | Helix Inbound Request* inbound integration for On-Demand or to the address of the xMatters Agent for On-Premise.  
Filter: XM:EI:EventInjection_100  

#### For Remedy/Helix On-Demand (v19.08 or later), get the endpoint URL
* On the *Workflows* page, click the **BMC Remedy and Helix | Incident | 7.5** then click **Integration Builder**
* Click the **4 Configured** link for Inbound Integrations
* Click the **Step 01 | Helix Inbound Request | JSON** link
* Scroll to the **How to trigger the integration** section then click **Select method** and **URL Authentication** 
* In **Authenticating User** begin typing the username for the REST integration user in xMatters and select the user
* Click **Copy** to copy the URL displayed in *Trigger*
* Paste the full URL as the endpoint in the Remedy/Helix filter

#### For Remedy/Helix On-Demand (v19.02), get the endpoint URL
* On the *Workflows* page, click the **BMC Remedy and Helix | Incident | 7.5** then click **Integration Builder**
* Click the **4 Configured** link for Inbound Integrations
* Click the **Step 01 | Helix Inbound Request | XML** link
* Scroll to the **How to trigger the integration** section then click **Select method** and **URL Authentication** 
* In **Authenticating User** begin typing the username for the REST integration user in xMatters and select the user
* Click **Copy** to copy the URL displayed in *Trigger*
* Paste the full URL as the endpoint in the Remedy/Helix filter

#### For Remedy On-Premise, get the endpoint URL for the xMatters Agent
* On the Workflows page, click the **BMC Remedy and Helix | Incident | 7.5** then click **Integration Builder**
* Click the **4 Configured** link for Inbound Integrations
* Click the **Step 00 | Incoming Remedy | xM Agent** link
* In **Integration Settings** *Step 1*, select **xMatters Agent** in **Location** and select the appropriate Agent
* Scroll to the **How to trigger the integration** section then click **Select method** and **URL Authentication** 
* In **Authenticating User** begin typing the username for the REST integration user in xMatters and select the user
* Click **Copy** to copy the URL
* Paste the full URL as the endpoint in the Remedy/Helix filter

### Configuring ITSM user
The integration requires a dedicated ITSM user to interact with incidents.

#### Create an ITSM user
First, create a new ITSM user with the Incident Master role in BMC Remedy/Helix; the user does not need to be Support Staff.

<kbd>
  <img src="media/RODITSMUser.png">
</kbd>

**Note: If you specify a Login ID of "xmatters" for this ITSM user, you can skip the following two update steps.**

#### Update the filter qualification
The XM:Incident_Re-Assigned_899 filter contains the following qualification criteria: `($USER$ != "xmatters")`  

This qualification prevents the integration from sending a second notification based on an incident's assignment changing because of a user response to an earlier notification. Replace `xmatters` with the name of the ITSM user created in Step One.

<kbd>
  <img src="media/RODUpdateFilterQual.png">
</kbd>

#### Update the default assignee
The out-of-box permissions allow the Submitter and Assignee (and BMC Remedy administrators) to search instances of the XM:Event Injection form. This allows users who modify incidents to see the corresponding XM:Event Injection instance for their update. To allow the ITSM user to also see all the Event Injection forms, modify the default value for the Assigned To field to the ITSM user you created.  

<kbd>
  <img src="media/RODUpdateDefaultAssignee.png">
</kbd>

### Disabling automatic assignment
To allow xMatters to control assignments, you must turn off the automatic assignment feature in BMC Remedy.

**Note: To perform this step, you will need to login as a user with Administrator permission.**

* Log in to the BMC Remedy Mid Tier web server.
* Click **Applications**, and then click the **Administrator Console** left-menu item.
* Click **Application Administration Console**.
* On the **Custom Configuration** tab, expand **Incident Management**, and then expand **Advanced Options**.
* Select **Rules**, and then click **Open**.
* Click the **New search** button then click the **Search** button to perform a search for all existing "Incident Rules".
* For each existing rule, do the following:  
      Select the rule, and in the **Assignment Process** drop-down list, select **(clear)**.  
      Click **Save**.  
      Alternatively, you can set **Assignment Engine Integration** to "No", then **Save**.  

# Testing

## Triggering a notification
To trigger a notification, create a new incident with a priority of High or Critical in BMC Remedy/Helix, and assign it to
a user or group that exists in both BMC Remedy/Helix and xMatters:

# Troubleshooting
If an xMatters notification was not received you can work backwards to determine where the issue may be:  
* Review the xMatters Reports tab and the specific [Event Log](https://help.xmatters.com/ondemand/installadmin/reporting/eventlogreport.htm)  
* If no Event was created, review the [xMatters Workflows Flow Designer Activity Panel](https://help.xmatters.com/ondemand/xmodwelcome/flowdesigner/activity-panel.htm)  
* If no activity was recorded, in Remedy/Helix review the XM:Event Injection Form and the XM:Action Form and the Remedy/Helix logs for a POST to xMatters.
